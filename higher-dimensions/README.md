# Higher dimensions of the Mandlebrot set
By rendering the logistic map of a functon, and allowing r values to be complex, you can create a 3, 4 or even 5 dimensional rendition of the fractal. this folder makes use of my [Hyperspace Renderer](https://github.com/Slothagami/hyperspace-renderer) project.

Check out the [renders folder](renders/) to see what it looks like.
