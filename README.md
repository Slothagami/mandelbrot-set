# Mandlebrot Set Renderers
Renderers that I've made for the mandlebrot set, ranging from the [standard rendition](standard-rendition/), to visualising [3 dimensional projected slices of a 5 dimensional representation of the fractal](higher-dimensions/renders/logmap-4d/gifs/Logmap-130-sp-%5B-2.5%5D-nr10-SLICE.gif).
